# Evaluates2-Core-Values

_Our unique and down-to-earth core values are a part of what make Evaluates2 such a great place to work!_

1. ***_Integrity_*** Tell the truth and act in a responsible way that is in the best interest of the clients, Evaluates2, and your team members. Always try to do the right thing and be tranparent with your team members.
   
2. ***_Respect_*** - Recognize the human rights and privacy of others, reject all kinds of discrimination, and stop judging others altogether. There are things each of us can learn from and teach to every other person, and we can have discussions and build awesome software together without hurting each other's feelings.

3. ***_Growth_*** - Evaluates2 is an awesome environment for learning new things and experiencing firsthand what TDD-XP-Agile development looks like in practice. As a small and quickly growing company, we expect a lot more growth in terms of projects, clients, and engineers!

4. ***_Innovation_*** - Help the clients see what they really need. Fail fast and don't get discouraged. Be open-minded to the idea of other teammates, and create a culture where everyone's voice can be heard and where decisions are based on statistically data rather than the boss's gut feelings.

5. ***_Efficieny_*** - We are always on the lookout for ways we can improve our processes and workflow, allow our tests to give us confidence to deploy rapidly, and in general try to write the simplest, most understandable code.

2. ***_Fun_*** - That's right, fun is a first-class core company value here at Evaluates2. Finding humor in the work, celebrating our victories, and setting aside time and resources for team building activities allÂ  aim to fuel the enjoyment and excitement employees feel in the morning before going to work at Evaluates2. You may decide to trade your labor for compensation with another company, but once you are hired here you are a member of the Evaluates2 family forever.
